## 🧩 Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them

### 1. Supabase Authentication — Learning from Scratch

The hardest part of this project was setting up authentication using Supabase since it was completely new to me. At first, it felt confusing — understanding the difference between the server client and browser client, how cookies work with SSR, and how to properly manage sessions in Next.js App Router. I didn't give up. I watched YouTube videos, asked questions on ChatGPT, and learned whatever was needed for this. With some trial and error, I was able to understand it and get authentication working for BookNest.

### 2. `createClient()` Not Being Awaited

**Problem:** After wiring up login and register, every auth action crashed with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'signInWithPassword')
```

**Root cause:** The Supabase server client (`createClient()` in `utils/supabase/server.ts`) is an `async` function because it needs to `await cookies()`. But in `auth-actions.ts`, I was calling it without `await`:
```ts
// ❌ Bug — supabase is a Promise, not the client
const supabase = createClient();
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(data); // crashes
```

**Fix:** Added `await` to every `createClient()` call:
```ts
// ✅ Fix
const supabase = await createClient();
```

### 3. Login Redirecting Back to Login (Route Group Confusion)

**Problem:** After successful email login, the app redirected right back to the login page instead of the dashboard. An infinite loop.

**Root cause:** The dashboard page lived at `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`. In Next.js, parenthesized folders like `(dashboard)` are **route groups** — they don't create a URL segment. So `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` served the `/` route, NOT `/dashboard`. But `app/page.tsx` was redirecting to `/dashboard` after login, which didn't exist as a route. The middleware saw no matching page, treated it as unauthenticated, and sent the user back to `/login`.

**Fix:** Moved the dashboard from `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` to `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (without parentheses) so `/dashboard` becomes a real route.

### 4. Middleware Not Preserving Session Cookies

**Problem:** Even after fixing the route, login still looped back. The session cookie wasn't surviving the redirect.

**Root cause:** The Supabase middleware was using the **old deprecated** cookie API (`get`, `set`, `remove`) instead of the current `getAll`/`setAll` API. The old API didn't properly forward auth cookies in the response, so every new request appeared unauthenticated.

**Fix:** Rewrote `utils/supabase/middleware.ts` to use the official `getAll`/`setAll` pattern:
```ts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.17 or later
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**
- A **Supabase** project ([create one free](https://supabase.com))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/booknest.git
cd booknest
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Open **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` — this creates:
   - `bookmarks` table with RLS policies
   - `auth_logs` table with RLS policies
   - Performance indexes
   - Realtime publication

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 5. Configure Google OAuth (Optional)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add `https://your-project-id.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` as an authorized redirect URI
4. In **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers**, enable Google and paste your Client ID and Secret
5. In **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration**, add your redirect URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### `bookmarks`

| Column       | Type        | Description                  |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| id           | UUID (PK)   | Auto-generated unique ID     |
| user_id      | UUID (FK)   | References `auth.users(id)`  |
| title        | TEXT        | Bookmark display name        |
| url          | TEXT        | Bookmark URL                 |
| is_favorite  | BOOLEAN     | Favorite flag (default false) |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-generated timestamp     |

### `auth_logs`

| Column       | Type        | Description                       |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| id           | UUID (PK)   | Auto-generated unique ID          |
| user_id      | UUID (FK)   | References `auth.users(id)`       |
| email        | TEXT        | User email at time of event       |
| event        | TEXT        | `login` / `register` / `google_login` / `logout` |
| ip_address   | TEXT        | Client IP address                 |
| user_agent   | TEXT        | Browser user agent string         |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMPTZ | Auto-generated timestamp          |

Both tables have **Row Level Security** enabled — users can only access their own rows.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add environment variables in Vercel's dashboard:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
4. In **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration**, add:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback
   ```
5. Update Google OAuth redirect URI if using Google sign-in
